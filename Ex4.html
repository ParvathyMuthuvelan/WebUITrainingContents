Visibility: hidden; hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout. Child element of a hidden box will be visible if their visibility is set to visible.
Display: none; turns off the display and removes the element completely from the document. It does not take up any space, even though the HTML for it is still in the source code. All child elements also have their display turned off, even if their display property is set to something other than none.
